Howdy!

I work on the Spring team.

This code repository is what I built during the following podcast episode:

This live stream has everything it takes to hook up a Spring Boot 3 application to Google and YouTube, including setting up the stuff on Google itself.

During the broadcast, I hit a quirky scenario. My `YouTube` interface was public but its return type was not. Afterward, I
patched it so that all works. I also added the CSS stylesheet that I alluded to during the broadcast.

If you want more, then be sure to pre-order my up-and-coming book, https://springbootlearning.com/book[Learning Spring Boot 3.0 3rd Edition].

Enjoy!
